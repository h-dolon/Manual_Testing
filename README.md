## Introduction
Manual testing is a crucial part of the software development lifecycle. This repository is designed to provide a structured and comprehensive approach to manual testing, covering various aspects like test case creation, bug reporting, and requirement verification through acceptance criteria and mind mapping.

## Test Cases
Test cases are designed to validate the functionality of the software application and ensure it meets the specified requirements.

- **Description:** Detailed test cases covering various scenarios and functionalities.
- **Format:** Test cases are documented in [Excel/CSV/Markdown] format.

## Bug Reports

Bug reports document the defects found during testing, providing detailed information for developers to understand and fix the issues.

- **Description:** Comprehensive bug reports with steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results, and severity.
- **Format:** Bug reports are documented in [Excel/CSV/Markdown] format.

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria define the conditions that a software application must meet to be accepted by the end-user or client.

- **Description:** Clear and concise acceptance criteria for various features and functionalities.
- **Format:** Acceptance criteria are documented in [Markdown/Plain Text] format.

## Mind Mapping

Mind mapping is used to visually organize information, representing the relationships between different aspects of the testing process.

- **Description:** Mind maps illustrating the testing process, feature breakdowns, and test scenarios.
- **Format:** Mind maps are created using [XMind/MindMeister] and exported as images/PDF.
